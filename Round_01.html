		 After beating the Dolphins and Redskins, the Giants lost all chances at <br>
		Chase Young or Jeff Okudah. Some may think Gettleman takes one of his famous <br>
		 "Hog Mollies" like Andrew Thomas, but Simmons has been far to impressive to pass on.<br>
		 During the National Championship game against LSU, Simmons showed us how versitile he <br>
		 really can be while lining up at slot and safety. He will have an immediate impact<br>
		 on the worst pass defense in the league last year.<br>

		<u><h3> Round 2 Pick 36: Justin Jefferson <img src="Images/lsu.png"
		width = 40 height = 40> </h3></u>

		<p2 style = "text-align: left";>

		I was going to reach for Tee Higgins here, but I really do not think he will drop<br>
		to day 2. The Giants still have a true number 1 receiver fall into their laps here.<br>
		Jefferson can immediatley step in as the number 1 opposite Darius Slayton. Once again,<br>
		the Giants could have gone with a tackle, but unfortunatley I don't think Gettleman is ready<br>
		to move on from Nate Solder.<br>

		<u><h3> Round 3 Pick TBD: Trey Adams <img src ="Images/Washington.png"
		 width = 50 height = 50> </h3></u>

		<p3 style = "text-align: left";>

		The Giants traded away their 3rd round pick for Leonard Williams, but they get a comp pick<br>
		for losing Landon Collins in free agency and use it to get a possible franchise Left Tackle.<br>
		I know I said that Gettleman was not ready to move on from Solder, but due to injury<br>
		Adams falls to round 3. At one point, Adams was in the day 1 discussion, so this pick is<br>
		a low risk high reward. He has the size and characteristics to be a franchise Left Tackle.<br>
