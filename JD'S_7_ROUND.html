			The NFL playoffs coming to an end can only mean one thing, 
			Draft Season is upon us. The New York Giants have been nothing<br>
			short of awful the past few years. This off-season, fans were calling for the 
			firing of General Manager Dave Gettleman and Head Coach Pat Shurmur,<br>
			but Gettleman's job was spared. This year will be a make or break
			for Gettleman who was brought here to rebuild the team, but after <br>
			many questionable draft picks and off-season moves, things are not looking good.
