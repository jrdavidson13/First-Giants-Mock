		<u><h3> Round 5 Pick 132: Chase Lucas DB <img src="Images/ASU.jpg"
		 width = 50 height = 50> </h3></u>

			<p1 "text-align: left";>
				
				
				Wide Receiver U? Thats an argument for another day, but Chase Lucas deserves<br>
				some love too. The Giants need to find a replacement for Janoris Jenkins and all<br>
				4 corners they drafted a year ago do not seem capable. Lucas was pretty solid while<br>
				at ASU and if he adds some size, he is more than capable of making the adjustment to<br>
				the next level.<br>

		<u><h3> Round 6 Pick 164: Julian Blackmon S <img src="Images/Utah.png"
		width = 50 height = 50> </h3></u>

			<p2 "text-align: left";>
				
				Having Blackmon fall to the 6th round is huge for the Giants because they <br>
				desperatley need a free safety to go alongside Jabrill Peppers. Blackmon <br>
				put up a strong campaign for the Aggies, but in order to be successful in the <br>
				NFL he is going to have to get stronger<br>

		<u><h3> Round 7 Pick 196: Ben Bartch G <img src="Images/stjohn.png"
		width = 50 height = 50> </h3></u>

			<p3 text-align: left>
				
				If Ben Bartch was not invited to the Senior Bowl he probably would not<br>
				even be drafted, but he was. Bartch has the size Gettleman loves, so <br>
				if he performs at the Senior Bowl and is available expect Gettleman to<br>
				pull the trigger.

		<u><h4> Round 7 Pick 222: Trevon Hill DE <img src="Images/Miami.png"
		width = 50 height = 50> </h3></u>

			<p4 text-align: left>
				
				Some people are skeptical fo Trevon Hill, but if he cleans up his act a bit<br>
				he can be a solid football player. Using a pick this late or even signing him as <br>
				an UDFA is a low risk-high reward. Minimally he will be a solid back up.
